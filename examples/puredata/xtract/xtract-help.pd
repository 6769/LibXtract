#X text 24 19 ________;
#X text 22 52 [xtract~] provides a wrapper for the feature extraction
library: LibXtract. Please refer to the documentation at libxtract.sourceforge.net
\, for a full explanation of the library and the functions it provides.
Only the operation of the PD external will be explained here along
with a few use case scenarios.;
#X text 20 148 [xtract~] must always be called with one argument \,
in the following form: [xtract~ <feature>] \, where <feature> is a
feature supported by the LibXtract library. A complete list of features
may be obtained by sending the external a |help( message:;
#X obj 27 262 xtract~;
#X msg 27 233 help;
#X text 26 298 Other than this help message \, the data sent to the
left inlet should always be a 'signal' (i.e. audio rate). This is the
data from a which a given feature will be extracted.;
#X text 27 405 Any additional arguments that need to be passed to the
feature extraction funtion must be provided as a list to the right
inlet \, e.g.;
#X obj 182 490 xtract~ mean;
#X floatatom 132 586 10 0 0 0 - - -;
#X floatatom 253 523 5 0 0 0 - - -;
#X msg 182 522 list \$1;
#X obj 132 556 xtract~ variance;
#X obj 181 466 phasor~ 0.1;
#X text 39 641 Below are some possible use cases (click to open):;
#X text 26 352 The outlet may be a scalar (control rate) \, or a vector
(audio rate) \, depending on the nature of the feature that is being
extracted.;
#X obj 42 665 f0;
#X obj 83 665 mfcc;
#X connect 5 0 4 0;
#X connect 8 0 10 0;
#X connect 8 0 11 0;
