2007-01-29 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.4.0
	* Added namespacing for macros and enumerations
	* Made most macros private
	* Rationalised formats for data (*data and argv) to create consistency
	between functions
	* Added spectral_mean() and friends
	* Added feature descriptors (see libxtract.h/descriptors.c

2006-12-15 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.4
	* Changed xtract_lowest_match(), to xtract_lowest(). It just returns the
	lowest non-zero component in the input array, between two bounds
	* qualified int *data, int N, and void *argv as const, thus insuring
	that they won't be modified by the called function.
	* added facilities for some functions to operate on copies of input
	data instead of modifying it. This will need to be optimised at some
	point maybe.
	* Added arguments to spectral flatness to allow for control over input
	band and pre-scaling
	* Fixed confusing xtract_init_mfcc() parameter order
	* Added new xtractor xtract_failsafe_f0

2006-12-12 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.3
	* Fixed errors in skewnes, kurtosis, irregularity_k, irregularity_j,
	tristimulus_1, tristimulus_2, and tristimulus_3.
	* Tested the above
	* Changed rolloff so output is in Hz. This means that a second
	argument (samplerate) needs to be passed in as argv[1]
2006-12-11 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.2
	* changed xtract_inharmonicity so that it takes frequencies AND
	amplitudes of peaks from *data rather than via *argv. This is
	consistent with xtract_centroid and others, and it means the data can
	come directly from xtract_peaks
	* Improvements to pd example (fixed memory allocation bugs)
2006-12-10 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.1
	* Fixed xtract_init_mfcc (array entries zeroed out if not set)
2006-11-10 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.0
	* Corrected typos in scalar.c
	* Added -Wall to CFLAGS and corrected problems relating to warnings
	* Added xtract_harmonics and corresponding documentation
2006-11-10 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.2.2
	* Fixed 'bus error' crash on Mac OS X by adding 'extern' declarations
	to xtract and xtract_help_strings	
2006-10-24 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.2.1
	* Fixed _xtract and _xtract_help_strings memory alloc bug
	* Added new macro

2006-10-18 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.2.0
	* added PD help files
	* added simple help system

2006-10-12 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.1.2
	* improved xtract_f0
	* changed versioning scheme

2006-10-09 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * Released version 0.11
