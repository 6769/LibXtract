Add -fPIC in intelligent way to build system for 64-bit builds
Rationalise use of powf etc. vs pow
Add spectral_flux
Add geometric_mean
Add spectral_mean, spectral_deviation, spectral_geometric_mean etc.
Add weighted temporal features as per Peeters (xtract_weighted_mean etc) weight given as argv?
Improve noise robustness of xtract_f0
Fix xtract_hps - it doesn't work!
Add Pure Data help file
Add delta functions
Add Max/MSP external example
Check and add return values as appropriate. Make them more sensible!
...do other stuff and eventually...
...optimise!
Use the fftw guru interface to create multipurpose global plans from xtract_fft_init()
Add LPC via Schur algorithm
If argv uses an integer, then it should point to a variable of type int. At the moment floats are used to store ints.
Write macro to truncate numbers <= 0 prior to taking log and integrate into functions across the library
Add xtract_subbands() - gets subband power or subband magnitude for given bands
